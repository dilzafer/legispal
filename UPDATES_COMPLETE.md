# âœ… Updates Complete - Bill Search & Detail Page

## What I Fixed

### 1. Jurisdiction Selection Now Works Properly

**Before:** Jurisdiction selection wasn't being used effectively
**After:** You can now select any state and search bills from that specific state

**How it works:**
- Click the filter icon in the search bar
- Select a state from the dropdown (e.g., Texas, New York, Florida)
- Type your search query
- Results will show bills only from that state
- If no state is selected, defaults to California (best data)

âœ… **Header with Status Progression**
